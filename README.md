RedditSentimentAnalysis
=======================
This is a script that takes in a reddit username as a parameter, then scrapes the first 100 comments of said user and determines the overall positivity ratio of the comments via [TextBlob](https://github.com/sloria/textblob). As of now, it prints out the top 10 positive comments, then top 10 negative comments (these are sorted lists), then the overall ratio

######TODO
 * Filter the results based on the objective/subjective value of the sentiment
