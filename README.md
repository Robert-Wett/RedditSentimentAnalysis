Grab a reddit user's latest comments on reddit, and run them against the popular TextBlob (NLTK-based) python library to get an overall "Sentiment" rating (postive or negative statements). The top 10 rated positive comments and their sentiment ranking, as well as the top 10 negative comments will be shown as well as the overall `are you happy` score.
